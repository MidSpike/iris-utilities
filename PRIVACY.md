#### For the rest of this document the following apply:
- id = a number used by Discord for identifying users, guilds, emojis, messages, attachments, etc
- name = the (user/nick)name of an individual (in/out of) a guild
- tag = the username of an individual (in/out of) a guild appended by a discriminator
- discriminator = the 4-digit sequence of numbers after a Discord username prepended by a '#'
- guild(s) = Discord Guild(s) that this bot resides in
- user(s) = you, a guild owner, users (in/out of) said guild
- Bot = the Discord Bot that showed you this file
- command_prefix = (by default: %) the method of accessing this Bot in a Guild containing this Bot
- command = anything sent by a Guild User that starts with the command_prefix

#### The Bot collects, processes, and stores the following information known as 'command_message_history':
- Messages (starting with the command_prefix) sent in Guild Text-Based Channels
- Messages including @mentions of this Bot

#### Command_message_history includes the following information:
- The entire Message involved (message text, embeds, attachments, etc)
- User information attached to that Message: id, name, tag
- Guild information attached to that Message: id, name

#### If you wish to have your command_message_history removed then you can do the following:
- Use command `request_history_deletion`
- Join the Bot's Guild and contact staff (use command `support_discord` to receive an invite to the Bot Support Guild)

#### The Bot collects and stores the following additional information known as 'guild_config_information':
- Guild Config information (generated by guilds when they add/use the Bot)

#### Guild_config_information includes the following information:
- guild: id, name, member count
- guild owner: id, name, tag
- the last known connection of guild and Bot
- other various information related to the functionality of Bot commands

#### This document will be updated in the future to better inform users of how data is managed and stored in the Bot.
