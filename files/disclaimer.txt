For the rest of this document the following apply:
- id = an number used by Discord for identifying users, guilds, emojis, messages, attachments, etc
- name = the (user/nick)name of an individual in a guild or otherwise outside of a guild
- tag = the username of an individual in a guild appended by a discriminator
- discriminator = the sequence of numbers after a Discord username prepended by a '#'

The Bot collects, processes, and stores the following information:
- Messages (starting with the command_prefix) sent in Guild Text Channels

The above are referred to as command_message_history in this document.

Command_message_history includes the following information:
- The entire Message involved (message text, embeds, attachments, etc)
- User information attached to that Message: id, name, tag
- Guild information attached to that Message: id, name

If you wish to have your command_message_history removed then you can the following:
- Use command "request_history_deletion"
- Message the owner of the Bot ( @MidSpike#4322 )
- Join the Bot's Guild (use command "support_discord")

The Bot collects and stores the following additional information:
- Guild Config information (generated by guilds when they add the Bot)
The above are referred to as guild_config_information in this document.

Guild_config_information includes the following information:
- guild: id, name, member count
- guild owner: id, name, tag
- the last known connection of guild and Bot
- other various information related to the functionality of Bot commands

This document will be updated in the future to better inform users of how data is managed and stored in the Bot.
